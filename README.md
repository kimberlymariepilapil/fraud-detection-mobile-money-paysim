- Dataset: PaySim (synthetic mobile money transactions)
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Explainability: SHAP
- Fairness Auditing: Proxy-based group metrics

## Repository Structure
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks (main analysis)
- src/: Feature engineering utilities
- models/: Trained model artefacts
- reports/: Final capstone report
- presentations/: Technical and business slide decks

## Dataset
The PaySim dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ntnu-testimon/paysim1

Due to file size constraints, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

## Reproducibility
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Open the notebook in `notebooks/`
3. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`
4. Run all cells sequentially
